## Lab Overview

This lab covers practical DevOps scenarios where prompt engineering with Cursor can significantly accelerate development and infrastructure management. You'll work through real-world examples that demonstrate the power of AI-assisted DevOps.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Use Cursor's ASK, Plan, and Agent modes effectively for DevOps tasks
- Generate optimized Dockerfiles for various application types
- Create Terraform configurations for cloud infrastructure
- Build GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines
- Implement Git workflows and best practices
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to common DevOps scenarios

## Cursor Modes for DevOps

### 1. ASK Mode
**When to use**: Quick questions, code explanations, or getting insights about existing code
- Use `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Linux/Windows) to activate
- Best for: Understanding existing DevOps configurations, troubleshooting issues
- Example: "Explain this Dockerfile and suggest optimizations"

### 2. Plan Mode
**When to use**: Planning complex infrastructure, breaking down large tasks
- Use `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to activate
- Best for: Architecture decisions, multi-step deployments, resource planning
- Example: "Plan a complete CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application"

### 3. Agent Mode
**When to use**: Multi-file changes, complex implementations, code generation
- Most powerful mode for generating complete solutions
- Best for: Creating entire infrastructure configurations, multi-file projects
- Example: "Create a complete Kubernetes deployment with monitoring"
