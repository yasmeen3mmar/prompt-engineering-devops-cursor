### 5.2 Infrastructure Monitoring and Observability

#### Exercise: Create Comprehensive Monitoring Stack

**Scenario**: Set up end-to-end monitoring for cloud infrastructure and applications.

**Use this comprehensive prompt**:
```
Create a complete monitoring and observability setup using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack with:

Infrastructure Monitoring:
- Prometheus configuration for Azure metrics collection
- Node exporters and custom metrics
- Alert rules for critical infrastructure issues
- Grafana dashboards for infrastructure overview

Application Monitoring:
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Custom application metrics
- Distributed tracing setup
- Log aggregation and analysis

Alerting:
- AlertManager configuration
- Slack/PagerDuty integration
- Escalation policies
- Runbook automation

Logging:
- ELK stack deployment (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Log pipeline configuration
- Log retention policies
- Security log analysis

Include Terraform for infrastructure and Kubernetes manifests for deployment.
```

### 5.3 Infrastructure Automation with Ansible

#### Exercise: Generate Ansible Playbooks for Multi-Environment Deployment

**Scenario**: Automate the deployment and configuration of applications across multiple environments.

**Use this comprehensive prompt**:
```
Create Ansible playbooks for infrastructure automation with the following requirements:

Inventory Management:
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Group variables for environment-specific configurations
- Dynamic inventory for cloud resources

Configuration Management:
- Node.js application deployment
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt
- System hardening and security updates

Database Management:
- PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- Database schema migrations
- Backup and restore procedures
- Performance tuning

Monitoring Setup:
- Prometheus and Grafana installation
- Application monitoring configuration
- Log management setup

Security:
- Firewall configuration
- SSH key management
- User management and access control
- Security scanning integration

Include:
- ansible.cfg configuration
- Requirements.yml for roles and collections
- Group and host variable files
- Vault files for sensitive data
- Documentation for running playbooks
```

### 5.4 Security-Focused DevOps Workflows

#### Exercise: Implement Security-First DevOps Pipeline

**Scenario**: Create a security-focused CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive security scanning and compliance checks.

**Use this comprehensive prompt**:
```
Create a security-focused DevOps pipeline with comprehensive security integration:

Static Security Analysis:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) integration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection and prevention
- Infrastructure as Code security scanning

Dynamic Security Testing:
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Network security testing

Compliance and Governance:
- GDPR compliance checks
- SOC 2 compliance automation
- Security policy enforcement
- Audit trail generation

Security Workflows:
- Security incident response automation
- Automated security patching
- Compliance reporting
- Security training integration

Infrastructure Security:
- Azure Security Center integration
- Network security group automation
- Identity and access management
- Encryption key management

Include GitHub Actions workflows, Terraform security modules, and documentation for security processes.
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Context-Rich Prompts
When working with complex infrastructure, provide detailed context:
- Current environment specifications
- Compliance requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security constraints

### 2. Iterative Refinement
Use follow-up prompts to build upon previous results:
- "Add monitoring to the previous Kubernetes deployment"
- "Enhance security in the generated Ansible playbooks"
- "Optimize the monitoring stack for cost efficiency"

### 3. Integration Prompts
Create prompts that integrate multiple technologies:
- "Integrate the Kubernetes deployment with the monitoring stack"
- "Add security scanning to the Ansible automation"
- "Create a complete CI/CD pipeline that includes all security checks"

## Best Practices for Advanced Scenarios

### Security Considerations
- Always include security best practices in prompts
- Specify compliance requirements upfront
- Include secret management in all configurations

### Performance and Scalability
- Define performance requirements in prompts
- Include auto-scaling configurations
- Specify resource limits and quotas

### Maintainability
- Request modular and reusable configurations
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Specify version compatibility and upgrade paths

### Cost Optimization
- Include cost optimization in infrastructure prompts
- Request monitoring for resource usage
- Specify cleanup and resource management

## Testing Advanced Configurations

1. **Validation**: Use Cursor to generate validation steps
2. **Testing**: Create test scenarios for different configurations
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to verify functionality
4. **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation

## Conclusion

This module demonstrates the power of prompt engineering in complex DevOps scenarios. By providing detailed context and using the right prompting techniques, you can generate sophisticated, production-ready infrastructure configurations that would typically require extensive manual work.

The key to success with advanced DevOps prompting is:
- Providing comprehensive context
- Being specific about requirements
- Iterating and refining based on results
- Integrating security, monitoring, and best practices from the start
